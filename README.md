# Limpopo Connect

A web application prototype for a social platform with two distinct modes: "Hookups" for discreet connections and "Community" for events, groups, and cultural engagement. This project is a static site built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating various frontend features and interactions.

## Features

*   **Dual Modes**: The platform is split into two themes and functionalities:
    *   **Hookups Mode**: A dark-themed, discreet interface.
    *   **Community Mode**: A light-themed, vibrant interface for community interaction.
*   **Theme Toggle**: Users can manually switch between a light and dark theme. The preference is saved in the browser's local storage.
*   **Simulated Forms**: All forms (Sign Up, Onboarding, Create Post, Settings) are functional placeholders. They capture user input and log it to the browser console without a real backend.
*   **Messaging Simulation**: A basic, non-functional chat interface where users can type messages and see them appear on the screen.
*   **Event RSVP**: A simulated RSVP button on event pages that changes state when clicked.
*   **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive and includes a mobile-friendly bottom navigation bar.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the components, loaded via a CDN. The configuration is done directly in a `<script>` tag in the HTML.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**: For all client-side interactivity, such as theme toggling, form handling, and UI simulations.
